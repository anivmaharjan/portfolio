                  <li><a href="#">Ceaser cypher</a></li>
                  <p>The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher that is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with his officials. It is a type of shift cipher, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. The number of places shifted is known as the key, and it determines the mapping of the plaintext to the ciphertext. </p>
                  <li><a href="#">Merge sort</a></li>
                  <p>Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts an array by dividing it into two halves, sorting each half, and then merging the sorted halves back together. The algorithm repeatedly splits the input list into smaller sublists until each sublist contains only a single element, then merges the sublists back together in a sorted manner. This results in a fully sorted list. Merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) and is a stable sort, meaning that the relative order of equal elements is preserved. In this program, you can enter any amount of numbers you want, and the algorith will sort it out in ascending order.</p>
                  <li><a href="#">Tic-Tac-Toe</a></li>  
                  <p>Tic-tac-toe is a simple two-player game that is often used to teach the concepts of game logic and strategy. In a Tic-tac-toe game, two players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (usually "X" and "O"). The player who succeeds in placing three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.</p>
